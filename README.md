Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression
Objective:
This repository serves as a comprehensive learning exercise, aiming to:

Apply fundamental machine learning concepts to a given dataset.
Evaluate, interpret, and justify results in a Jupyter notebook based on the observed dataset.
Analysis Overview:
The analysis is structured into five distinct parts, each documented in Jupyter notebooks within this repository:

Part 1: Identifying the Problem and Getting Data

Aim: Identify the types of information contained in our dataset.
Approach: Utilize Python modules to import external datasets, gaining familiarity with the data to facilitate thoughtful handling in subsequent steps.
Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Aim: Explore the variables to assess their relationship with the response variable.
Approach: Employ data exploration and visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Understanding the data is crucial for effective data preprocessing.
Part 3: Pre-Processing the Data

Aim: Identify the most predictive features and enhance the predictive power of the analytics model.
Approach: Utilize feature selection, extraction, and transformation techniques for dimensionality reduction. This step is vital in preparing the data before constructing predictive models.
Part 4: Predictive Model using Logistic Regression

Aim: Construct a predictive model to determine the diagnosis of a breast tumor.
Approach: Develop a logistic regression model to predict the binary variable (benign or malignant) representing the diagnosis of a breast tumor. Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix and receiver operating curves (ROC) will be utilized for model assessment.
Part 5: Optimizing the Logistic Regression Model

Aim: Fine-tune parameters of the logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
Approach: Utilize scikit-learn to optimize the Support Vector Classifier, enhancing its performance and predictive accuracy.
