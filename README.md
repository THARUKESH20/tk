Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Prediction repository! This project utilizes the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict breast cancer malignancy based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA). The dataset employed is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from scikit-learn.

Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises various features computed from FNA images, and the primary objective is to classify tumors into malignant or benign categories. This project serves as a demonstration of machine learning techniques applied to medical diagnostics.

Model Training and Evaluation
The Logistic Regression model is employed for training, and its performance is evaluated on both training and test datasets. The accuracy metrics provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities.

Prediction Example
An illustrative input example is included in the code, showcasing how the model predicts the malignancy or benign nature of breast tumors. The code is designed to be flexible, encouraging further exploration, parameter modification, and potential extensions.
