Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression
This repository contains a simple machine learning project for predicting breast cancer using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The dataset used in this project is the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the scikit-learn library.

Dataset
The dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's load_breast_cancer() function, and it consists of various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The goal is to classify tumors into malignant or benign categories based on these features.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb
or

bash
Copy code
python breast_cancer_prediction.py
Model Training and Evaluation
The Logistic Regression model is used for training, and its accuracy is evaluated on both the training and test datasets. The trained model is then used to predict whether a given set of features corresponds to a malignant or benign tumor.

Prediction Example
An example input is provided in the code, and the model predicts whether the corresponding breast cancer is malignant or benign.
